We worked on a game around the theme “Make Me Laugh” for 48 hours and had the game <a href="../../../projects/game_cart_lander/">CArT Lander</a> as our final product. We decided to use <a href="https://www.plasticscm.com/">Plastic SCM</a> for version control. Unfortunately, it is not available on my system, Garuda Linux.

Yunnan locates in Southwestern China and borders Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Mushrooms and spicy &amp; sour food are famous in the region. Two of us ordered four dishes and finished them all. The minced pork and hand-shredded chicken are particularly good with rice. The rice noodles are quite light, and the flavor is a bit mild. The fish dish tastes very fresh, the fish is boneless and melts in your mouth. For drinks, we tried the passion fruit mango, which was quite delicious and rich in fruit pulp. We even took another cup to go after our meal.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/food4.JPG-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/food4.JPG-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/food4.JPG-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/food4.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A funny welcoming cat at the desk. </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="holiday🌴"/><category term="Italy🇮🇹"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The best Chinese restaurant I have visited this year.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Porto Venere</title><link href="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2024/porto-venere/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Porto Venere"/><published>2024-01-03T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-03T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2024/porto-venere</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2024/porto-venere/"><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1qCA5Iztgf9eoZwuXiuVXK4Xh8KsoY9s&amp;ehbc=2E312F&amp;noprof=1" width="640" height="480"></iframe> <hr/> <h3 id="gulf-of-venus">Gulf of Venus</h3> <p>We decided to visit La Spezia when we were planning our trip.

The mountain paths were quite muddy, shaded by trees, and evidently hadn’t seen enough sunshine in recent days.</p> <p>Throughout the hike, we just followed a red-and-white sign. Occasionally, we also saw some signs written with ‘VF’ on it. We encountered no other hikers along the way and only saw a few inhabited houses after crossing the grassland.</p> <p>“If this were in Germany, there would definitely be other hikers,” I told <a href="https://github.com/spherinder">@spherinder</a> several times.</p> <p>Hiking seems to be a popular activity in Germany. My interest in hiking began when I was studying in high school there. I started in Schwerin, where I took an intensive German language course during regular school hours, Monday to Friday, for several months. With limited entertainment options nearby, I decided to explore all the lakes I could find on the map. I started with Lankower Lake, close to where I lived, and then visited Neumühler Lake, Fauler Lake, and others. Once, I even hiked from Schweiner Lake to the nearby city of Wismar with a few other Chinese students. It was a memorable experience, especially seeing deer twice in early spring and encountering a surprising hailstorm in March – certainly not the best weather for hiking.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/004.JPG-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/004.JPG-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/004.JPG-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/004.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A beautiful grassland on the way. </div> <h3 id="somewhat-windy">somewhat windy</h3> <div class="row mt-3"> <figure> <video src="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/007.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""/> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Hiking along the Monte Valoria. </div> <p>As we ascended the hills of Monte Valoria, the wind grew increasingly stronger.

If we weren’t quick enough, we might have to take refuge in the small church and spend the night there.</p> <h3 id="back-to-passo-della-cisa">back to Passo della Cisa</h3> <p>It didn’t take long to reach Passo della Cisa, where we found the owner (or so I assumed) of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/dZgroyZRjzwkK6Ly8">Bar Cisa</a> preparing to close up and return home to Berceto, our starting point that day.</p> <p>He graciously attempted to call local taxi services for us, but none were available at the moment. Understandably so, on the last day of the year, who would be willing to pick us up in such a remote location?</p> <p>Just as we were considering returning to the church to check if it was still accessible, the bar owner kindly offered us a ride to Pontremoli. We are still extremely grateful for his generosity.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hiking🥾"/><category term="Italy🇮🇹"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is about a 8.8km walk from the Berceto city to Passo della Cisa, followed by a ride to Pontremoli.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The wrong starting point</title><link href="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2023/the-wrong-starting-point/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The wrong starting point"/><published>2023-12-30T21:01:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-30T21:01:00+00:00</updated><id>https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2023/the-wrong-starting-point</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2023/the-wrong-starting-point/"><![CDATA[<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1rZp32wo1iVtklWTHjn9Qq7WJ9mLI4WM&amp;ehbc=2E312F&amp;noprof=1" width="640" height="480"></iframe> <hr/> <h3 id="original-plan">original plan</h3> <p>This time, I started the journey with <a href="https://github.com/spherinder">@spherinder</a> together to Italy. We traveled from Zurich through Chiasso on the 29th, using the night GA travelcard to get to Milano. Today is the second day of our trip. We plan to walk a section of the Via Francigena for a few days, until January 2nd, and return on January 3rd. That was our original plan.</p> <h3 id="jollibee-in-milano---the-most-popular-filipino-fastfood">Jollibee in Milano - the most popular Filipino fastfood</h3> <p>We spent a bit more time enjoying our morning coffee and then visited the Filipino fast-food giant, Jollibee, near the Duomo di Milano before taking a train to Berceto. Our plan was to start walking there, a good starting point not too far from La Spezia, where we will end our trip. We hoped to enjoy the Tuscan landscape during our hikes.</p> <p>About the food. It has been a while since my last time trying out Jollibee in the Philippines when I visited Boracay when I was still in middle school. I cannot fully recall how it tasted like, but the small chicken menu we ordered in Milano was pretty good.</p> <h3 id="seems-like-we-started-wrong">seems like we started wrong</h3> <p>After a quick stop in Parma to buy some Parma ham for our trip, we reached the Berceto train station at 4 pm. That’s when we realized that the actual town of Berceto was a couple of kilometers away from where we were, in Ghiare.</p> <p>We started our walk without much delay. Since it was getting dark, we decided to walk along the road used by cars. <a href="https://github.com/spherinder">@spherinder</a> found a muddy safety vest left by construction workers and put it on the backpack, so cars could see us better.</p> <p>Soon it started to rain heavily. No one else around here would have walked in such a downpour, and our unusual behavior caught the attention of some people. This included a kind lady driving in the opposite direction who wanted to make sure we were okay, and a police car that passed by.</p> <p>Two young policewomen were in the car. They rolled down the window and it seemed like they were asking us in Italian what had happened. Communication was difficult, but we managed to understand that they were trying to get us a taxi. <a href="https://github.com/spherinder">@spherinder</a> wanted to keep walking, but I was okay with taking a taxi since walking along the street with cars zooming by was not as enjoyable as we had expected.</p> <p>After giving us the phone number of the taxi driver, they drove away. They advised us to contact them if anything happened, to put on the safety vest, and to stand there quietly. They also suggested we send our current location to the driver. However, it turned out we couldn’t find the driver on WhatsApp somehow.</p> <p>We waited another 10 minutes without seeing any cars, until finally a car appeared. We waved at it, thinking it might be the taxi we were expecting. It turned out to be a man in his mid-30s with his young child. He kindly offered us a ride to the town of Berceto and called the taxi driver to let him know he didn’t need to come. It seemed the taxi driver hadn’t set out yet, so we felt a bit more relieved.</p> <h3 id="where-to-stay">where to stay</h3> <p>After saying goodbye to the kind family, we explored the town a bit. We found that most of the accommodations for pilgrims listed were closed until April 1st. We ended up staying at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/eozr9Es3qnbcWhnTA">B&amp;B Gioli</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/001.JPG-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/001.JPG-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/001.JPG-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/projects/viafrancigena/2023winter/001.JPG" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A cheerful feeling when finally seeing a Via Francigena sign in front of the B&amp;B Gioli. </div> <p>The host, Marino, was a very kind man. His house was cozy, making us feel warm and welcome. He immediately offered us a bottle of beer when we arrived and happily chatted with us in English. He mentioned that he retired 23 years ago but is still keen on learning English.</p> <p>Under his recommendation, our day ended with a great dinner at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/bFe1cziWnTCDA7aW7">Pizzeria Romea</a>.</p> <p>Tomorrow, we will finally start our first hike on the Via Francigena.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="hiking🥾"/><category term="Italy🇮🇹"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is about a 10km walk from Berceto train station, which is actually not in Berceto but locates in Ghiare, to the Berceto city.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Experience Report on SC22</title><link href="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2022/experience-report-on-sc22/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Experience Report on SC22"/><published>2022-01-12T15:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-01-12T15:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2022/experience-report-on-sc22</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://youwuyou.github.io/blog/2022/experience-report-on-sc22/"><![CDATA[<p>This post is a report about the routines of the student cluster competition at SC22.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Coding💻"/><category term="USA🇺🇸"/><category term="HPC✨"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is a report about the routines of the student cluster competition at SC22.]]></summary></entry></feed>
