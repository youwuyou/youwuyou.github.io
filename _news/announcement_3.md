ðŸ“‹ I successfully defended my bachelor's thesis in Institute of Geophysics ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ under the supervision of Dr. Luca Dal Zilio, Dr. Albert De Monserrat Navarro and Prof. Taras V. Gerya. I developed a 2D unified and generalized solver that contains architecture-agnostic kernels targeting CPUs/GPUs for fully compressible two-phase porous media in Julia.
