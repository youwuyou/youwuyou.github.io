⚔️ I competed in SC22 Student Cluster Competition as part of the ETH Zürich student HPC Team “RACKlette”, at Dallas, TX 🇺🇸. I was responsible for the HPC App "PHASTA" and obtained top results. "PHASTA" is a HPC software which supports modeling compressible or incompressible, laminar or turbulent, steady or unsteady flows in 3D, using unstructured grids. See our experience report [here](https://racklette.ethz.ch/blog/experience-report-on-sc22).
