Today marks the conclusion of our short winter holiday in Italy, a trip during which we stepped on the Via Francigena for the first time. As we head back to Zurich from La Spezia, our journey takes us through Milano, where we've scheduled a brief stopover. With a craving for Chinese cuisine, we've decided to visit a Chinese restaurant in Milano. '[Batong Ristorante 八筒](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kDUyevT7manN5hpc6),' with its high ratings and convenient location near the train station, stands out as an ideal choice.

Two of us ordered four dishes and finished them all.

- 霸王手撕鸡 - hand-shredded chicken

- 黑三剁 - minced pork with green and red peppers

- 老母鸡汤米线 - chicken soup rice noodles

- 百香果酸汤鱼 - sour soup fish with passion fruit

This Yunnan cuisine restaurant comes highly recommended. Yunnan locates in Southwestern China and borders Laos, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Mushrooms and spicy & sour food are famous in the region. Two of us ordered four dishes and finished them all. The minced pork and hand-shredded chicken are particularly good with rice. The rice noodles are quite light, and the flavor is a bit mild. The fish dish tastes very fresh, the fish is boneless and melts in your mouth. For drinks, we tried the passion fruit mango, which was quite delicious and rich in fruit pulp. We even took another cup to go after our meal.
