### Pontremoli

Today finally greeted us with sunshine! Before embarking on more hikes, we took a brief moment to explore the city. Our initial plan was to visit the [stele statue museum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/bBaUjSCr6J9e8N889), but to our disappointment, it was closed on the first day of the year. Additionally, they offer a guesthouse, open only from April 1st to September 30th. Perhaps on our next trip, when we tackle the hike from Passo della Cisa to Pontremoli, we'll be blessed with even better weather.

A special liturgy is scheduled to take place around noon at the Pontremoli Cathedral. However, since we need to set out on our journey, we will unfortunately have to miss it.

### _Silent Night_

Today's hike was incredibly refreshing. We crossed several bridges and encountered a beautiful, ancient church along the way.

The [Saint Stephen Church of Sorano](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nYBFLRK6cBeedVaMA) might not look too fancy from the outside, but its interior is beautifully decorated. By the time we visited, it had attracted a few other visitors. As the church bell chimed, its resonant tones giving way to the serene melody of the cherished Christmas classic, 'Silent Night' filled the air.

## sunset

The sun set early on this winter day, leaving us with about two hours of hiking in the dark, as we had started our journey around 13:00. The latter part of the hike was a bit challenging due to the muddy conditions, but overall, it was a nice day.
