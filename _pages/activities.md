### SC22 Student Cluster Competition

In November 2022, we went to Dallas, Texas for the student cluster competition. I was responsible for the HPC App "PHASTA" and obtained top results in my category. "PHASTA" is a HPC software which supports modeling compressible or incompressible, laminar or turbulent, steady or unsteady flows in 3D, using unstructured grids. Overall we got the 4th place among the on-site teams. Have a look at our [team homepage](https://studentclustercompetition.us/2022/Teams/RACKlette/index.html) and the [experience report](https://racklette.ethz.ch/blog/experience-report-on-sc22) about the competition routines.
