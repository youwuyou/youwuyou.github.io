My full name 吴莜 (Wú Yōu), including my surname [Wu](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Wu_(surname)), means 'carefree' in Chinese when in its original order.


### I am from

Xiamen （[📍 厦门](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QxrVADfiPfMnPTzs9)）, a subtropical island 🏝️ located on the southeast coast of China, overlooking the Taiwan Strait. Some of my best memories are just hanging out on the beach, walking by the sea with my mom, and playing fetch ⚾️ with my dog Nico.

### I study

[Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://n.ethz.ch/~youwuyou/assets/data/posterA4.pdf) at ETH Zürich. 🇨🇭 I am interested in high-performance computing and particularly in heterogeneous computing. I am also interested in physically based simulations. I have grown a keen interest in sparse linear algebra during my internship (09 - 11/2023) at [ICL](https://icl.utk.edu/).
