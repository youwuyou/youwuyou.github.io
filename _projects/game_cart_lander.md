## About this game

This is the very first game I have ever created! In a team of five, we created a game within 48 h at a game jam [(Global Game Jam 2024 @ ETHZ)](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/cart-lander-2). I was responsible for the feedback system including particle system, screen shake effects and the sound management etc. The feedback system was made possible through the [Feel library](https://feel.moremountains.com/) from MoreMountains.

In each game jam there is a specific theme that jammers inspire themselves from. This year's theme was "Make me laugh".
