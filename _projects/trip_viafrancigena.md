## several trips

Instead of spending 80 days on the hike in one continuous stretch, I decided to split it into several trips. Over the past three years, a lot has happened. I finished my high school studies in Wiesbaden and moved from Germany to Switzerland to continue my education. Due to my college schedule, I couldn't dedicate a large chunk of time spanning several months to hiking, so I decided to break the trip into smaller segments.

## difficulties and challenges

This time, I decided to embark on our first trip of the Italian segment in winter. The winter journey was definitely challenging, with limited accommodations available and tougher weather conditions. Since I don't speak Italian beyond some simple phrases that I learned from Duolingo or Babbel, it made the trip slightly more difficult, especially when trying to find places to stay. Some B&B owners spoke English, but most of them didn't speak any English at all. However, it was still possible to communicate a bit through a mix of simple Italian words and some Spanish.

Moreover, some road signs can be misleading. It is highly recommended to download offline maps of the itinerary before starting each stage. [The free app of Via Francigena](https://www.viefrancigene.org/en/guides-app/) is a very useful tool to have.
