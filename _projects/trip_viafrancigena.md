## why another pilgrimage way?

Via Francigena was my second attempt on a pilgrimage route after the [Camino Franc√©s](../trip_camino) back in 2018. 

## difficulties and challenges

The trip in winter was definetely challenging, with little accomendations avaliable and tougher weather conditions.


## several trips

Instead of spending the whole 80 days in one piece. I decided to split up the whole hike into several trips.
