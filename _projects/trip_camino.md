## how it started...

The first time I heard about the [Camino de Santiago](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Camino_de_Santiago) was in our religion course in high school, when I was 18 back in 2018. I cannot quite recall the exact contents how this pilgrimage way was brought up in class. But I became fairly interested in it.

Shortly before the summer holidays began, I impulsively decided to set on the trip. I wrote to the ["Pilgerstelle Bistum Limburg"](https://pilgern.bistumlimburg.de/beitrag/hier-pilgerausweis-beantragen/), bought a small but very compact [guidebook from KOMPASS](https://www.google.ch/books/edition/Kompass_Wanderf%C3%BChrer_Jakobsweg_Spanien/UmYuDwAAQBAJ?hl=de&gbpv=0) and received [the pilgrim's credential](https://oficinadelperegrino.com/en/pilgrimage/the-credencial/) shortly after. Got two weeks off under the allowances of the headmaster of our school. And here we go.

## preparation

I decided to bring as little clothes as possible and as it was summertime, I was able to bring just couple of T-shirts and shorts and plus some underwears it did not add much to the weight. But I somehow decided to bring a bibel with me. Not sure what 18-year-old me was thinking about at that moment, maybe I found it to be quite spiritual back then. This heavily increased the weight that I had to carry with me, but brought me some joy on the way when I got some chance to just sit and read on few pages. I also brought a small sketchbook so I could draw some funny stuff when I got bored just walking.

It was a careless decision throughout and it showed early enough that I should have brought a more professional hiking backpack that can help in reducing the weight on my shoulders alone by redistributing the weight a bit. The school backpack I used quickly broke away and I had to purchase a new one. Same with the shoes. Looking back from the future perspective I have right now, I would suggest to younger me to bring a pair of sandals or crocs and just tie them on the backpack. This could come in handy to spots where you need to step through water, which didn't happen a lot on my way as it was almost always good weather in the summer 2018 when I walked. But I could imagine the same way being muddy and tricky to step on in a cold, rainy winter day.

## where did I sleep

I did not consider much about accomendations before setting out, but it turned out I just pick the right time to walk, and the route I chose -- "Camino Francés" is probably the most organized route out of all possible pilgrimage ways, as it is very popular and attracts thousands of pilgrims every year. If one would like to walk on the same route but off-season in winter, you would probably want to make sure you can secure the next spot where you sleep at least a day prior to it.

In summer 2018 when I walked, I did not make any reservations nor call any albergues (🇪🇸 pilgrimage hostel). I always just arrive in one of the available accomendations and it actually worked out pretty well. On average it costed me 8 - 15 € per night and some places even offered free stay + food but requested some donations.

There was also once when I spent a night under a tent a Spanish couple set up and another two nights I spent alone in the forests in my hammock. But those were rather exceptional cases.

## underway for a month

I did enjoyed hiking but have never done such a long-distance hike before. But I was somehow confident that my feet would be able to carry me over these 800 kilometers, considering the average distance one needs to make was barely around 24 km / day. I am a very slow in walking though and most of the time I was among one of the last ones who arrived in the albergue. There were also a few days where I had to walk with blisters on my feet, that was painful and slowed me down even more.

I thought at the beginning it would be a solo hike but it turned out that I met a lot of "camino friends" along the way, hiked with different people, listened to their stories and said "buen camino" and farewelled to a lot of people as well.

Followings are some throughbacks on the trip that I made in 2018. I cannot find all the pictures and videos on the way, otherwise I would have put them all here.

### Day 1: Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port → Orrison

    The first day was the toughest day. It rained all along the way and it made climbing up the mountain more challenging as it became super slippery. I gradually lost a lot of my body temperature as I only wore a T-shirt and shorts in a summer day and did not expect the temperature drop. Luckily, after reaching the refuge Orisson and eating something, it became much warmer very soon. Considering the bad weather conditions, I decided to stay in Orrison and continue the rest of the stage the second day.

    After the whole day hike, I decided to take a small break and went up hills to explore the ruins of a small castle -- <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/mX4rKDyDJZEAN5797"> Castillo de San Esteban de Deyo o de Monjardín</a>.
 It was an astonishingly beautiful view up the hills when the sun gradually started to set down.

    I ended up in El Burgo Ranero... luckily, I enjoyed wonderful dancing and beautiful music... a group from León was performing in the village. The people there are very hospitable and like to talk to strangers and ask questions. Somehow, I was also invited to 'El corro' and moved around a bit haha. There were very few seats available. The older people would sit on the bench for just a few minutes and then they would ask other people standing nearby if they also wanted to sit. ❤️

    There's no black sheep in the flock haha. I somehow made a mistake at the beginning. Today, I walked about 35 kilometers in total... I didn't start until around 10:30 and the whole time I was really relaxed and slow haha. That's why it was already half-past nine when I finally arrived. Now, all I have to do is count the sheep. 🐑

Waking up up in the hills in O Cebreiro gave such an amazing panorama view -- with all the clouds filling up the vallies between the mountains. The day was accompanied with smell of chestnut trees. It was amazing to witness the lifely 800-year old chestnut tree standing at the beginning of the village of Triacastela, imaging what has happened to her in the past ages...

## some thoughts...

These were some notes I took on the last day of the trip.

>33日/799公里
>其实地上本没有路，走的人多了，也便成了路。
>就此，可能没有那条路是全然独行之路，但每个人确有独一无二的行路方式：有人旁若无人般吟啸而行、有人似始终只于朦胧中神游，亦有人只敢于与他人同行。即便只是趋之若鹜般涌向那一张张证书，何不也为一种选择？
>自己走好自己的路便好。
